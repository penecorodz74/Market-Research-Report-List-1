<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hair Transplant Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FUT</li><li>EUE</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hair transplant technology market primarily consists of two types: Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). FUT involves removing a strip of scalp and dissecting it into individual follicles for transplantation, allowing for high-volume grafting but leaving a linear scar. In contrast, FUE extracts individual follicular units directly from the scalp using specialized tools, resulting in minimal scarring and quicker recovery but typically requiring more time for the extraction process. Both techniques cater to different patient preferences and hair restoration needs.</p></p>
