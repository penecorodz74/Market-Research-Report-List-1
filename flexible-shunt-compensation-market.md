<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Shunt Compensation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Capacitive Compensation</li><li>Shunt Inductive Compensation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flexible shunt compensation market includes two main types: shunt capacitive and shunt inductive compensation. Shunt capacitive compensation is utilized to inject reactive power into the grid, improving voltage stability and minimizing losses. This technique is especially beneficial in systems with capacitive requirements. Conversely, shunt inductive compensation absorbs excess reactive power to maintain system stability and prevent overvoltage conditions, making it ideal for inductive load-heavy environments. Both types enhance overall grid reliability and efficiency by balancing reactive power.</p></p>
