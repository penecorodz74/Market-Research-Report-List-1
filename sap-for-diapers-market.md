<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SAP for Diapers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>'Solution-based Polymerization'</li><li>'Inverse Suspension Polymerization'</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer) market for diapers is categorized into two main types: solution-based polymerization and inverse suspension polymerization. Solution-based polymerization involves dissolving monomers in a solvent, leading to polymer formation, which enhances the absorbency and performance of the final product. Inverse suspension polymerization, on the other hand, involves dispersing the monomers in a continuous phase, typically water, which results in beads that maximize fluid absorption. Both methods are crucial for producing high-quality SAP used in diaper manufacturing.</p></p>
